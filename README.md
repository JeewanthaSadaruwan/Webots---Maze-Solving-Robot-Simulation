# Webots---Maze Solving Robot Simulation

Project Overview

I built this project for the IESL Robogames 2024 competition, university category, organized by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering of the University of Moratuwa and the Institution of Engineers, Sri Lanka (IESL). This competition challenges participants to design and implement innovative robotic solutions that showcase technical proficiency, problem-solving skills, and creativity.

Objective

The main objective of this project was to create a robot capable of navigating a maze dynamically while adhering to specific competition rules. The robot is designed to visit target zones marked with colors (Red → Yellow → Pink → Brown → Green) in the given sequence, regardless of its starting position. Upon completing the task, the robot is programmed to stop automatically.

Features and Capabilities

Maze Navigation: The robot utilizes an efficient pathfinding algorithm to dynamically detect and avoid walls using its left, right, and front sensors.

Color Detection: Equipped with advanced color detection capabilities, the robot identifies and interacts with specific target zones based on their color.

Dynamic Adaptability: The robot can adapt to varying maze layouts, ensuring it completes its task regardless of its starting location.

Stop Condition: Once all target zones are visited in the specified order, the robot halts its operation, signaling task completion.
